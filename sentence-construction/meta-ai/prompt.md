        Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts. Here are some clues to help you get started:

        "Bears" is a noun, and in Japanese, it's.
        "at the door" can be translated using the word (, door) and a phrase that indicates location.
        "did you leave" is a question about an action that happened in the past. Think about how to conjugate the verb "to leave" in Japanese.
        "the garbage" is a noun, and in Japanese, it's.
        "out" can be translated using a verb that means "to put out" or "to take out".

        Here's a vocabulary table to help you:
        | Japanese	| Romaji	 | English
        |	        | kuma	     |  bear
        |	        | tobira	 | door
        |	        | gomi	     | garbage
        |	        | nusunda    | to leave (something behind)
        |	        | dasu	     | to put out, to take out

        Now, can you try to put the sentence together in Japanese?
